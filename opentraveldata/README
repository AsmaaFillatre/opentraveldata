Overview
========
That directory contains the files maintained by the OpenTravelData
team (http://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata) for various
types of travel-related referential data:
* Points of Reference (POR). For now, only the POR having got a IATA code.
* Countries and continents.
* Time-zones for a few POR.
* Airlines and alliances. For now, only the airlines having a 2-letter
  IATA code.
* Aircraft.

Geographical-related Data
=========================
A few files are maintained, others are generated.

Curated
-------
* optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv is the list of best known details
  for the Points of Reference (POR), for geographical coordinates,
  serving city and Geonames reference.
* optd_por_no_longer_valid.csv is the list of no longer POR.
* optd_regions.csv and optd_region_details.csv are the list of regions
  from various projects or institutions (UN WTO, Geonames).

Generated
---------
* optd_por_public.csv

Mixed
-----
* optd_por_best_to_reject.csv is the list of POR not referenced by IATA.
  A typical use case is when the FAA code has been taken for the IATA code,
  for instance with DAW, as of May 2015: http://geonames.org/5092710.
  Someone should go through that list, check it item and item, and amend
  the corresponding records, usually in Geonames, where the mistake has been
  done in the first place. IATA may be the culprit in some other cases.
* optd_por_tz.csv. Overall curated, but regurlaly generated thanks to GeoBases
  and Geonames
* optd_country_region_info.csv and optd_cont.csv are the lists of countries,
  with their associated details. Those are generated from Geonames. 
* optd_por_diff_w_geonames.csv is the list of geographical distances
  for the POR, as known from optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv on one hand,
  and as known by Geonames on the other hand.
  Someone should go through that list, check it item by item, and amend
  the corresponding records, usually in optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv,
  where the mistake (for geographical coordinates) has been done most of
  the time. Sometimes the culprit may be Geonames; but it is then easy to amend.

Airlines
========

##
# The only file to be maintained is the list of best known coordinates, i.e.,
# the optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv CSV data file, which is made of three
# fields:
#  - IATA code
#  - latitude
#  - longitude

##
# The make_optd_por_public.sh Shell script generates the more detailed 
# optd_por_public.csv CSV data file, which is a merge of three POR data files:
#  - ORI-maintained data file: optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv
#  - Geonames data file: dump_from_geonames.csv
#  - (The public part of the) Amadeus RFD data file: dump_from_crb_city.csv

##
# The optd_only_por.csv CSV data file contains (as of March 2012) 106 airports,
# which appear neither in Geonames nor in Amadeus RFD. For instance, some
# Web sites mention AAD as the IATA code of the Ad-Dabbah airport in Sudan.
# However, all those Web sites give unconsistent geographical coordinates,
# and neither of those corresponds to an actual airport (as checked with
# Google Maps, Bing Maps, MapQuest and OpenStreetMap). So, those airports
# are kept in the optd_only_por.csv data file, for reference, with more details
# than in the generated optd_por_public.csv file, at least for some of those
# airports.

##
# By construction, there can be three types of update:
#  - By ORI, within the optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv file,
#    which is the list of the best known coordinates.
#    Note that those changes generally occur when integrating the latest
#    updates from Geonames, thanks to the scripts in the ../tools directory
#    (e.g., update_airports_csv_after_getting_geonames_iata_dump.sh).
#    See the ../tools/README documentation for more details on the corresponding
#    use cases and usages.
#
#  - By Geonames, within the dump_from_geonames.csv file, itself
#    generated by the ../tools/preprepare_geonames_dump_file.sh script.
#    Note that, as the geographical coordinates should have been already
#    integrated within the optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv file, only
#    the POR details (e.g., the name, state, country) should be updated.
#
#  - By Amadeus RFD, within the dump_from_crb_city.csv file. Idem as for
#    Geonames.
